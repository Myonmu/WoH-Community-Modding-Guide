**NOTE: This list is an alphabetical list of all Items that can be found in World of Horror (version 0.9.92). It does NOT include any values, places where to find etc etc.** 

If you want more detailed descriptions of items, I refer you to the Item List on Steam (might be incomplete and/or incorrect), made by PaperRabbit: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2009870553

Items that are extremely hard to get (OP weapons) or are items used/provided by Mysteries have been noted as such. Consumable and equipable items are also described as such. Items unlocked via achievements are noted as such.

**Items preceded with #SP are not obtainable via normal means (shops, enemy drops, mystery rewards), but can be 'spawned' via custom event/enemy modding.**
