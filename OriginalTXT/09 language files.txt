IMPORTANT FOREWARNING PLEASE READ FIRST!!!:

Unlike all custom stuff that works by adding stuff, the already existing .jn files are read by the game to provide (all?) in-game text. Meaning, you're editing core part of the game.

ALWAYS back up your translated files, and ALWAYS keep the backup of original English texts somewhere safe. In case you screw up, you will have the ability to go back fix things (otherwise you will have to uninstall and install WoH again).

Also, future updates will probably include changes to game's texts (typo fixes, line adjustments etc), so expect the .jn files to be overwritten in case a hotfix/update is released by panstasz (you did backup your translation, right? Right??)

GENERAL HOW TO:

All files have .jn filetype; it seems to be another custom filetype made by panstasz. They can be easily opened by any plainstext editor, even Windows Notepad

The files themselves are stored in: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\WOH\language

I strongly recommend getting something that comes with word and line counter, for example Notepad++. Why?

Because all files are long, long lists of strings. This means you gotta know which string relates to what place/menu/event, otherwise you will be very lost and confused (especially that the files also contain un-released stuff as well).

Panstasz uses |10 |20 |30 and so on to indicate which line this is, probably because he does that by hand (the madman). I recommend you leave these in too.

SUPPORTED UNICODE BLOCKS:

The game uses Silver font from poppyworks.itch.io and therefore available Unicode blocks depend on the font's supported blocks.

The list can be found here: https://itch.io/t/488011/currently-supported-unicode-blocks

The font iself supports many accented characters, and panstasz periodically updates the in-game sheet with new letters. For the most part, common Scandinavian and Romance umlauts/accented letters are supported.
