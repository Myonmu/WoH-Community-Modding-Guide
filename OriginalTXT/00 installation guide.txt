***INSTALLATION GUIDE (WINDOWS OS / STEAM):***

Hello and welcome, here's a list of where put which custom content (as of version 0.9.92)

If you do not have either of the folders specified below, just make them.

**CUSTOM EVENTS, CUSTOM ENEMIES:**

`C:\Users\yourusernamehere\AppData\Local\wohgame\custom `
(if this folder does not exist, create it manually). Make sure it is **NOT** `wohgame\extra_content\custom` as the game does not read files from there.

Put all events and enemies in there. Various .ito files should go there, art usually gets put into subfolders by the modders.

**CUSTOM CHARACTERS:**

`C:\Users\yourusernamehere\AppData\Local\wohgame\character `
(if this folder does not exist, create it manually). Make sure it is **NOT** `wohgame\extra_content\character` as the game does not read files from there.

Put all characters in there. Like above, .ito files go directly there, art into subfolders.

There's a hard limit of 28 custom characters that will be loaded by the game (they're loaded alphabetically per filename).

**CUSTOM MYSTERIES:**

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\WOH\mystery` 
(or elsewhere, depends where you installed Steam itself. If this folder does not exist, create it manually.) Make sure it is **NOT** `wohgame\extra_content\mystery` as the game does not read files from there.

Put the mysteries in there. Same rules apply as above.

The game will the load 8 random mysteries and apply them to Mystery Board/Custom Mystery List during playthrough for you to choose. To get a new batch, simply 'q'uit the playthrough and start a new one.

**CUSTOM TRANSLATIONS:**

**Applying a translation will break all your modded content due to how modding uses language files for coding, instead of game code itself. Only use translations to play with vanilla content.**

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\WOH\language` (or elsewhere, depends where you installed Steam itself)

Put the .jn files in there, and agree to overwrite. **Consider putting the original English translation somewhere else as backup in case something goes wrong.**

***INSTALLATION GUIDES FOR OTHER SYSTEMS***

Note that these are contributed by other users and I am unable to verify their accuracy (I don't have a Mac/Steam Deck)

Mac:

For anyone also trying to get mods to work under the Mac steam version, I figured it out! The necessary path for the custom/character/mystery folders is not /Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/WOH, but instead /Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/com.panstasz.wohgame. 
In other words, whether it's the steam version or not is irrelevant, what counts is the App ID (which is com.panstasz.wohgame).

Steam Deck:

On the Steam Deck, the path where the "custom" and "character" directories should go is: /home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/913740/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/wohgame
If you can't find it for some reason, I found it by running find /home/deck -iname save.ito on Konsole. Since it's the same directory where the save.ito file is.
